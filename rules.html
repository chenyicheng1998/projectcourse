            <li><strong>Flight Distance Limit:</strong> Each flight leg cannot exceed 5,000 km.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Considerations:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good Weather: You can land at the selected airport.</li>
                    <li>Bad Weather: Thunderstorms, heavy rain, or snow will prevent you from landing, and you must select an alternate destination.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Crossing Longitude:</strong> During your journey, you must cross every longitudinal line.</li>
            <li><strong>Eligible Airports:</strong> Players can only land at large, international airports with suitable facilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Completing the Game:</strong> The round-the-world trip is completed when the player returns to Singapore Changi Airport.</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> Players are ranked based on the total distance flown. The shorter the total distance, the better your rank.</li>
            <li><strong>Replayability:</strong> Players can retry as many times as they want. The leaderboard will store your best attempts.</li>
